# DataEngineering-in-Apache-Cassandra
An music company might want to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team will be particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. This data which resides in a directory of CSV logs on user activity on the app will need a way to be queried upon. This data engineering project implements an Apache Cassandra database with creation of tables that can create queries on song play data to answer the questions.
